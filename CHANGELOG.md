# v0.5.3

## New stuff

- `lcmath`: The `phase_bin_magseries_with_errs` function can now accept
  per-measurement weights to allow different errors for each measurement. Added
  by @lgbouma.

- `services.tesslightcurves`: The `get_eleanor_lightcurves` function now accepts
  an optional `targetdata_kwargs` dict to pass in custom target info parameters
  to the underlying `eleanor.TargetData` constructor. Added by @lgbouma.

- `services`: A new `alltesslightcurves` module to get all available TESS light
  curves for an object was added by @mchris42.

- `checkplot.png`: The `_make_phased_magseries_plot` function now accepts a
  `trimylim` kwarg to remove large outliers. Added by @lgbouma.

- Gaia EDR3 support is now available in all functions in the `services.gaia`
  module and the dependent functions in the `checkplot`, `identifiers`, and
  `varclass.starfeatures` modules. Set the `data_release` kwarg to 'dr2' for
  using DR2, and 'edr3' to get data from EDR3.

  The Vizier TAP service mirror for EDR3 (currently) uses column names that are
  different from the Gaia main EDR3 and Heidelberg EDR3 mirrors. The
  `services.gaia.objectlist_conesearch`, `services.gaia.objectlist_radeclbox`,
  and `services.gaia.objectid_search` functions will fall back to DR2 if the
  Vizier mirror is used. To avoid this, use another mirror, setting the
  `gaia_mirror` kwarg to either 'gaia' or 'heidelberg'.

## Changes

- The default timeout for the SkyView service clients in `plotbase` and
  `services.skyview` has been changed to 45 seconds.

- Minor fixes for deprecated methods in `matplotlib` and `numpy`.

## Fixes

- `services.gaia`: The Heidelberg mirror URL now uses HTTPS and should no longer
  fail all the time.


# v0.5.2

## Fixes

- `periodbase`: fix check for Astropy version tags so the import doesn't fail
  when the version contains letters.


# v0.5.1

## Fixes

- `lcproc.catalogs.add_cpinfo_to_lclist`: make sure the catalog dict's 'columns'
  key's value is a list so it can be appended to.

# v0.5.0

This is a new major release. Support for Python 2.7 has been dropped. Astrobase
now requires Python 3.5+.

## New stuff

- New `services.tesslightcurves` module to retrieve TESS HLSP light curves from
  MAST. This requires the astroquery, eleanor, and lightkurve packages. By
  @lgbouma.
- `services.identifiers`: new `tic_to_gaiadr2` function. By @lgbouma.

## Fixes

- `periodbase.kbls`: now resorts the input times, mags, errs by time to avoid a
  segfault in the wrapped `eebls` Fortran code. Should fix #94.
- `services.lccs`: now includes the logging bits to make it an actually
  standalone module.

## Changes

- `periodbase`: all period-finder functions now resort their input times, mags,
  errs arrays by time before operating on them.
- `cpserver`: reorganized the Tornado handlers into their own modules.
- various `flake8` formatting fixes all over the package
- removed Python 2 specific code all over the package

## Removed

- The deprecated `astrobase.varbase.lcfit` module has been removed. Use the
  top-level `astrobase.lcfit` subpackage instead.


# v0.4.3

## New stuff

- New `services.limbdarkening` module to retrieve limb-darkening Claret+ 2017
  coefficients from Vizier (just for the TESS band for now). Added by @lgbouma.
- New `services.identifiers` module to convert between SIMBAD, GAIA DR2, and TIC
  identifiers for objects. Added by @lgbouma.
- New `imageutils` module for some simple FITS operations.
- Added the `fivetransitparam_fit_magseries` function to `lcfit.transits` for
  fitting a line plus a Mandel-Agol transit model with everything fixed leaving
  the t0, period, a/Rstar, Rp/Rstar, and inclination as free parameters. Added
  by @lgbouma.

## Fixes

- Minor fixes to the `checkplot` and `services` subpackages.


# v0.4.2

## Changes

- All `lcfit` functions now use `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` instead of
  `scipy.optimize.leastsq` previously. This appears to produce much more
  reasonable fit parameter error estimates.
- `periodbase.kbls`: The BLS stats functions now check for a sensible transit
  model when calculating stats (transit depth, duration, SNR, refit period and
  epoch).
- `checkplot.png`: Added option to overplot circle on DSS
  finder-charts. `checkplot.png.twolsp_checkplot_png` can now return a
  `matplotlib.Figure`. Added by @lgbouma in #86.

## Fixes

- `lcproc.tfa`: Fixed caching of collected LC info when generating a TFA
  template.
- `checkplotserver`: Fixed column errors in exported CSV from the interface
  (#85).

## Removed

- Removed deprecated function
  `astrotess.get_time_flux_errs_from_Ames_lightcurve`. Use
  `astrotess.read_tess_fitslc` instead.
- Removed deprecated module `services/tic.py`. Use `services/mast.py` instead.


# v0.4.1

## New stuff

- `periodbase.kbls`: now returns BLS stats along with the period finder results.

- `varbase.trends`: added External Parameter Decorrelation with arbitrary
  external parameters, optimizer function, and objective function.

- `periodbase`: added a wrapper for the Transit Least Squares period-finder
  (Hippke & Heller 2019; added by @lgbouma)

- `periodbase.zgls`: added calculation of the analytic false-alarm probability.

- `services.gaia`, `services.mast`: added single-object search-by-name
  functions.

- `lcfit.utils`: added an `iterative_fit` function.


## Changes

- `lcproc.tfa`: now removes template objects from consideration if they're too
  close to the target object.

- `periodbase`: broke out all of the functions in `periodbase/__init__.py` to
  `periodbase/utils.py` and `periodbase/falsealarm.py` as appropriate.


## Fixes

- `periodbase`: fixed epsilon checking against values of previous best periods
  when iterating through periodogram peaks (by @joshuawallace).

- `periodbase.zgls`: now correctly uses `tau` in the calculation of the
  periodogram value.

- `varclass.starfeatures`: fixed missing `and` in an if-statement (by
  @joshuawallace).

- `lcproc.tfa`: various bug-fixes.


# v0.4.0

This is a new major release. Several modules have been moved around. Most public
facing modules and functions now have full docstrings that auto-generate Sphinx
documentation (https://astrobase.readthedocs.io).

Work for the v0.4 series of releases will be tracked at:

https://github.com/waqasbhatti/astrobase/projects/1

## New stuff

- New top-level `lcproc`, `checkplot`, and `lcfit` subpackages.
- `services.mast`: now has a `tic_xmatch` function.
- `lcfit.transits`: added new `mandelagol_and_line_fit_magseries` function (by
  @lgbouma).
- `timeutils`: added new `get_epochs_given_midtimes_and_period` function (by
  @lgbouma).
- New `periodbase.abls` module to use Astropy 3.1's BoxLeastSquares as the BLS
  runner instead of the wrapped eebls.f used by
  `periodbase.kbls`. `periodbase.kbls` remains the default implementation when
  you do `from astrobase import periodbase`. You can call
  `periodbase.use_astropy_bls()` immediately after importing `periodbase` to
  switch the default BLS implementation to `periodbase.abls`.

## Changes

- `varbase.lcfit` has been moved to a new top-level subpackage called `lcfit`,
  and is broken up into `lcfit.sinusoidal`, `lcfit.eclipses`,
  `lcfit.nonphysical` and `lcfit.transits` submodules. The `varbase/lcfit.py`
  module will be removed in Astrobase 0.4.5.
- `lcproc.py` has been moved to a new top-level subpackage called `lcproc`, and
  is broken up by specific functionality.
- `checkplot.py` has been moved to a new top-level subpackage called
  `checkplot`, and is broken up into `checkplot.pkl` for making checkplot
  pickles, and `checkplot.png` for making checkplot PNGs.
- `periodbase.kbls.bls_stats_singleperiod` and `periodbase.kbls.bls_snr` now do
  a trapezoidal transit model fit to the prospective transit found by an initial
  run of BLS and calculate the transit depth, duration, ingress duration, refit
  period, and refit epoch that way.
- `plotbase`: the function `plot_phased_mag_series` is now called
  `plot_phased_magseries`.
- `plotbase`: the function `plot_mag_series` is now called
  `plot_magseries`.
- `lcproc_aws.py` has been moved to `lcproc.awsrun`.
- `lcproc` now uses JSON files stored in either `[astrobase install
  path]/data/lcformats` or `~/.astrobase/lcformat-jsons` to register custom LC
  formats. This is more flexible than the older approach of adding these to a
  top-level dict in `lcproc.py`.
- `lcfit.sinusoidal`: the `fourier_fit_magseries` function now returns
  times.min() as the `epoch` value in its `fitinfo` dict (by
  @joshuawallace). The actual time of minimum light is returned as
  `actual_fitepoch` in the `fitinfo` dict.
- `periodbase/oldpf.py` has been moved to `periodbase/_oldpf.py`. It will be
  removed in Astrobase 0.4.2.
- The `services.tic` module has been deprecated and will be removed in Astrobase
  0.4.2.
- The `astrotess.get_time_flux_errs_from_Ames_lightcurve` function has been
  deprecated and will be removed in Astrobase 0.4.2. Use the
  `astrotess.read_tess_fitslc` and `astrotess.filter_tess_lcdict` functions
  instead.
- We no longer run the Astrobase test suite on Python 2.7. Most things should
  continue to function, but there are no guarantees. Python 2.7 support will end
  in December 2019.

## Fixes

- Lots of bug fixes everywhere. See the commit history for details.

- `astrotess` now has `read_tess_fitslc`, `consolidate_tess_fitslc`, and
  `filter_tess_fitslc` functions like `astrokep`.
- new `services/mast.py` module for querying the STScI MAST API. Added a
  `tic_conesearch` function to help with future checkplot making that will
  include TIC IDs and TESS mags.
- `lcproc.register_custom_lcformat` can now provide arbitrary kwargs to the
  LC reader and normalization functions.


## Changes

- `services`: service clients that talk to single mirrors now use a random sleep
  before launching the request to avoid overload when running in many parallel
  processes.
- `checkplot, starfeatures`: include all GAIA neighbor proper motions instead of
  just the target object proper motions.
- `starfeatures` functions now recognize TESS and Kepler mags for checkplot
  making.
- `services/lccs.py`: updated for v0.2 of the LCC-Server's API.
- `lcproc.make_lclist` now accepts an input list of actual filenames to turn
  into a lclist catalog pickle.
- `hatsurveys.hatlc.normalize_lcdict_byinst` now also uses the LC's CCD column
  to generate the normalization key.


## Fixes

  functions.
- Added `services/tic.py` by @lgbouma containing a basic TESS Input Catalog at
  MAST API client.
- `lcproc.parallel_cp`: can now slice task lists using start and end indices.


## Changes

- `services/skyview`: added configurable retry behavior if the downloaded FITS
  file is corrupted.

  service queries time out faster when the services are not responsive.

## Changes

- `lcmath.sigclip_magseries`: `sigclip` can now be either int or float.

## Fixes

- lcfit: in the `*_fit_magseries` functions, `fitmagminind` can be a
  multiple-item array instead of a single item for flat light curves. This will
  break the time-of-minimum finding routine for an LC fit. Now uses the first
  item in the array for `magseriesepoch` if this is the case. Added by
  @joshuawallace.

# v0.3.17

## New stuff
